    <h2>3. A cat was the Mayor of an Alaskan town for 20 years</h2>

    <h2>4. The record for the longest cat ever is 48.5 inches</h2>

    <h2>6. Cats walk like camels and giraffes</h2>
    Have you ever noticed that cats walk like camels and giraffes? Their walking sequence is both right feet first, followed by both left feet, so they move half of their body forward at once. Camels and giraffes are the only other animals to walk this way. Don’t believe us? Take a look at this video!

    <h2>7. Isaac Newton invented the cat door</h2>
    The scientist is most famous for calculated gravity, but it’s also believed that Isaac Newton invented the cat door. How Stuff Works writes that when Newton was working on his experiments at the University of Cambridge he was constantly interrupted by his cats scratching at the door. So he called the Cambridge carpenter to saw two holes in the door, one for the mother cat and one for her kittens! Apparently these holes can still be seen at the university today.

    If you’ve watched your little kitty charging around the living room when they’re feeling lively you know that cats are pretty quick, but you won’t believe this cat fact. They can hit speeds of around 30mph which is so fast that they could beat Usain Bolt in a 200-metre dash!

    <h2>12. The oldest cat in the world was 38 years old!</h2>
